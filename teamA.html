    <h1>Team A</h1>
    <p>
        Team A is composed of dedicated members always willing to take on challenges. Members of this team wrote the “VRC Girl Powered Essay Challenge,” detailing their unique experiences as women in robotics, and how this has shaped their experiences and those of people around them. This team also consists of avid programmers who built our club website from scratch, learning a lot of programming skills along the way. Members of Team A also participated in the “‘Thinking Outside the Box’ Photography Challenge.” They took incredible pictures and described their significance to them, and how it relates to robotics.
